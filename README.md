# Neural Nexus: AI-Powered Learning Management System

## Overview
**Neural Nexus** is an innovative educational platform that dynamically generates personalized learning content based on user queries and tracks learning progress across customizable timelines. This system leverages no-code AI application generators to create tailored learning experiences for users at different skill levels.

> **Note:** This project is currently under active development. Features and functionality may change as the system evolves.

## Core Features
- **AI-generated course content** based on user search queries
- **Flexible timeline structures** (3, 6, 9, or 12 months)
- **Personalized learning paths** and comprehensive progress tracking
- **Automated assessment generation** with instant feedback
- **Multi-agent AI architecture** for sophisticated content creation and management

## Technical Architecture
Neural Nexus is built on a modern stack that includes:

- **Front-end Application**: User interface for registration, login, and content consumption
- **make.com Integration**: Central workflow automation platform that processes learning requests
- **AI Service Connections**: Integration with external Large Language Models for content generation
- **Data Management**: Robust storage structure for user data and generated content
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient content delivery systems

## How It Works
Neural Nexus follows a streamlined workflow:

1. **User Interface**: Users log in or register through the front-end application
2. **Learning Request**: Users specify what they want to learn and their desired timeframe
3. **make.com Integration**: Requests are processed through make.com's automated workflow
4. **Content Classification**: The system analyzes the subject matter and determines appropriate content types
5. **Timeline Customization**: Content is structured according to the user's specified timeframe
6. **Content Generation**: Personalized learning materials are created through make.com AI system
7. **Content Delivery**: Generated materials are returned to the front-end application for user consumption

## Implementation Phases
The system is being developed in eight key phases:

1. **Foundation Setup**: User interface and entry point creation
2. **Curriculum Generation**: Multi-agent AI architecture implementation
3. **Learning Dashboard**: Dynamic progress visualization interface
4. **Content Delivery**: Lesson view and resource library
5. **Assessment System**: Quiz and project interfaces with feedback mechanisms
6. **Progress Tracking**: Comprehensive timeline and competency tracking
7. **User Profile & Settings**: User management and customization options
8. **Analytics Dashboard**: Learning patterns and content effectiveness monitoring


## Development Status
Neural Nexus is currently in active development. We are working on:

- Improving the integration between the front-end and make.com workflows
- Enhancing the content generation capabilities
- Refining the user experience and interface
- Expanding support for diverse learning topics and timeframes
- Implementing robust testing and quality assurance protocols

We welcome feedback and suggestions as we continue to develop this platform.
